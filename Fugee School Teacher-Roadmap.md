# Fugee School Teacher Roadmap

## The BIG Idea
The BIG idea is to _**introduce**_ and _**inspire**_ students into Technology, specifically through front-end development coding. With that, we do not believe in shoving down knowledge (information overload) but we’ll aim at teaching students how to think (creatively) – problem solving and logical thinking.

## Tips for Teaching
- Please have loads of fun and enjoy yourself, do not get stress out when things do not go according to plan
- Keep it simple, stupid
- Give students something to achieve every week, so they can see that they are progressing.
- Try your best to give analogy/story in almost every explanation, so that student will get better idea.
- Always encourage students. 
- Be aware of the surrounding. If students are not following, slow down. 
- Throw your voice to the class. 
- Make an effort to contact your partner and prepare with him / her one week beforehand. This is so people can provide feedback when you upload your material. 
- Give students the direction on what we are planning to learn from the beginning.  
- Helpers try to allow students to type themselves even when they'll be slow. Do not take over their laptop. 

## Grand Execution Plan (Final Assignment)
By the end of the semester, each group (6 groups since we are limited to 6 desktops) should complete their own website with requirements as below:-
- At least 5 pages
- Make use of HTML5 and CSS elements
- Contain navigation
- Consistent header, footer and menu
- JavaScript elements

## Sub Execution Plan
We'll have 6 milestones where each month's theme will focus to teach/learn the concepts that leads to the completion of the final assignment.
- Milestone #1 - Static Website: HTML5 and CSS3 basics
- Milestone #2 - Static Website: Layout (i.e. tables, div, flexbox)
- Milestone #3 - Static Website: Navigation (i.e. menu, anchor linking for one page website)
- Milestone #4 - Responsive Website: Deploy website to server, JavaScript basics for effects
- Milestone #5 - Responsive Website: TBC
- Milestone #6 - Responsive Website: TBC

## Tool  
Use http://codepen.io/ to code HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Save as one account to retrieve the files for later use.  
Credential: jecelyn / password  
Note: Skeleton website is created in Codepen for those who missed some classes.

**Milestone #3** - Navigation   
**Week 5** – Menu and Anchor Linking  
**Mentors** - Daphne (Main Mentor) & CY (Helper)  
**Objective**: Ensure that students build their menu of at least 4 links (i.e. About Me, Interest, Aspirations, My Country) and understand how to link up to different sections of their one-page website.      
**Duration**: 2 hours  

1. Recap on objective of one page website we are trying to build (20 mins)
   * Display sample personal websites (i.e. http://jenifferdake.com/ or http://www.colingrist.com/)
   * Draw on the board a sample website layout with additional menu and sections (for anchor linking purposes).  

2. Learning / Tutorial (1 – 1.5 hours)
   * First, create the menu at the top of your website:
   ```
   <div id="nav">
     <ul>
         <li class="first"><a href="#about">About Me</a></li>
         <li class="second"><a href="#interest">Interest</a></li>
         <li class="third"><a href="#aspirations">Aspirations</a></li>
         <li class="fourth"><a href="#country">My Country</a></li>
     </ul>
   </div>
   ```
   * Then add the anchor code below for each of the My-Info section:
   ```
   <div class="my-info">
      <a id="about" ></a> About page content goes here.
   </div>
   ```
   * Continue for the rest of the sections as declared in the menu above:
   ```
   <div class="my-interest">
      <a id="interest" ></a> Interest page content goes here.
   </div>
   <div class="my-aspirations">
      <a id="aspirations" ></a> Aspiration page content goes here.
   </div>
   <div class="my-country">
      <a id="country" ></a> Country page content goes here.
   </div>
   ```
   * Alright, HTML part is done! Now is time to style the menu and sections:
     * First, make each section a large height of 1000px each.
     ```
     .my-info, .my-interest, .my-aspirations, .my-country {
        height: 1000px
      }
      ```
      * Then, make the navigation div (```nav```) a fix height of 70px.
      ```
      #nav {
        height: 70px;
      }
      ```
      * We want the navigation unordered list (```ul```) to display on the right. We also want to remove the default bullet discs on the list items.
      ```
      #nav ul {
        float: right;
        list-style: outside none none;
      }
      ```
      * Instead of the menu list items (```li```) lining up vertically, we want them to line up horizontally. Add ```display:inline-block;``` to ```#nav li```. We also want a bit of spacing between the text and the side of the boxes (padding). Add ```padding: 8px 18px;``` to ```#nav li```.
       (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_box_model)
      ```
      #nav li {
        display: inline-block;
        padding: 8px 18px;  
      }
      ```
      * We want to make the text looks nicer. For the font size and family, add ```font-size: 14px;``` and ```font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;```. Use a grey colour by adding ```color: rgb(77,77,77);```. We do not want the text to be underlined, add ```text-decoration: none;```. 
      ```
      #nav a {
        font-size: 14px;
        font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;
        color: rgb(77,77,77);
        text-decoration: none;
      }
      ```
      * Lastly, we want to have matching colours to the menu items and the sections (light blue, yellow, red and green).
      ```
      #nav li.first {
        background-color: #7CB0C3;
      }
      .my-info {
        background-color: #7CB0C3;
      }
      
      #nav li.second {
        background-color: #FFCC5C;
      }
      .my-interest {
        background-color: #FFCC5C;
      }
      
      #nav li.third {
        background-color: #F3716D;
      }
      .my-aspirations {
        background-color: #F3716D;
      }
      
      #nav li.fourth {
        background-color: #96CEB4;
      }
      .my-country {
        background-color: #96CEB4;
      }
