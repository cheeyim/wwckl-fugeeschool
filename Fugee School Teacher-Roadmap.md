# Fugee School Teacher Roadmap

## The BIG Idea
The BIG idea is to _**introduce**_ and _**inspire**_ students into Technology, specifically through front-end development coding. With that, we do not believe in shoving down knowledge (information overload) but we’ll aim at teaching students how to think (creatively) – problem solving and logical thinking.

## Tips for Teaching
- Please have loads of fun and enjoy yourself, do not get stress out when things do not go according to plan
- Keep it simple, stupid
- Give students something to achieve every week, so they can see that they are progressing.
- Try your best to give analogy/story in almost every explanation, so that student will get better idea.
- [SOME GOOD ADVICE – DEAR MENTORS, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE YOUR TWO CENTS HERE BUT LET’S KEEP THIS SHORT =)]

## Grand Execution Plan (Final Assignment)
By the end of the semester, each group (6 groups since we are limited to 6 desktops) should complete their own website with requirements as below:-
- At least 5 pages
- Make use of HTML5 and CSS elements
- Contain navigation
- Consistent header, footer and menu
- JavaScript elements

## Sub Execution Plan
We'll have 6 milestones where each month's theme will focus to teach/learn the concepts that leads to the completion of the final assignment.
- Milestone #1 - HTML5 and CSS3 basics
- Milestone #2 - Layout (i.e. tables)
- Milestone #3 - Navigation (i.e. simple JavaScript animation, menu and images)
- Milestone #4 - HTML Forms (i.e. input types, elements, attributes, validation, JavaScript posting)
- Milestone #5 - JavaScript basics
- Milestone #6 - TBC
